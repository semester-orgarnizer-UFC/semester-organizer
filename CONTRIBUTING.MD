# How to contribute
You can contribute in a lot of ways, it can be [coding](#how-to-contribute-with-coding), [reporting bugs](#report-a-bug), [requesting new features](#how-to-request-a-new-feature) or even using the project and telling us what did you think about it.

## How to report a bug

-    Access https://github.com/semester-orgarnizer-UFC/semester-organizer/issues

-    Click on New Issue

-    Put a detailed title and on the description, if you don't mind, put as much information as possible: expected behavior, screenshots.

## How to request a new feature

-    Access https://github.com/semester-orgarnizer-UFC/semester-organizer/issues

-    Do the same procedure as the [bug report](#how-to-report-a-bug), but instead of bug, put a feature, let's say: I would like to login with google instead of creating my own account 

## How to contribute with coding

-    Clone the repository

-    `git checkout staging`

-    Check if there's one issue that you could work on

  > If there's no issue, feel free to create one
  
-    Grab the issue number, let's say (42) and then, create a branch called: `fix/#42`.

-    `git pull origin main`

> Solve the possible conflicts

-    Commit your changes and pushes your branch

> Don't forget to follow the good practices of a commit: (#$ISSUE_NUMBER - $TAG: $MESSAGE COMMIT) -> #142 - fix: remove the entity User
